Once upon a time I swore I had a heart
Long before the world I know tore it all apart
Once upon a time there was a part of me I shared
Years before they took away the part of me that cared

I’ve been a thousand places and shook a million hands
I don’t know where I’m going but I know just where I’ve been
I’ve flown a million miles and I’ve rode so
